# blockchain-iot
In this project we will integrate the protocol [LWM2M](https://omaspecworks.org/what-is-oma-specworks/iot/lightweight-m2m-lwm2m/) with blockchain technology. A Java implementation of LWM2M protocol called [Leshan](https://github.com/eclipse/leshan) and Ethereum testnet [Ropsten](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/) will be use for this purpose.

This repository is divided in three main folders:
* **blockchain** --> Smart Contracts are stored here
* **docs** --> Project documentation
* **leshan** --> Java Implementation of LWM2M protocol. Modified to accomplish communication with Ropsten network
